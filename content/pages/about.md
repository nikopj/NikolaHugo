Hello. My name is Nikola Janjušević (Никола Јањушевић, 言有为). I am a first year 
**PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering** at New York University under the advisory of Professor 
Yao Wang at the [NYU Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/). My current interests are in *sparse representation-learning*, *deep-learning*,
*wavelets*, and *optimization*. 
Outside of academia I spend my time skateboarding with my brother and my friends and occasionally 
taking photos.
